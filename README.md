# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction App

This interactive web application predicts the likelihood of **heart disease** using a trained **Random Forest Classifier**.  
It was developed as part of my applied research in medical data analysis and machine learning â€” integrating data preprocessing, model optimization, and deployment into an intuitive Streamlit interface.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Predicts the presence of heart disease based on clinical data.
- Machine learning pipeline built with **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **XGBoost**.
- Web interface developed using **Streamlit** for interactive predictions.
- Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for easy public access.
- Scalable and easily extendable for future healthcare applications.

## ðŸ§  How It Works
1. The machine learning model (`best_model_RandomForestClassifier.pkl`) was trained using patient data with features like **age, cholesterol, blood pressure, resting ECG results**, and others.
2. Users input medical parameters into the app.
3. The app preprocesses the inputs, applies scaling, and feeds the data into the trained model.
4. The model outputs a prediction indicating whether the patient is **at risk of heart disease or not**.
